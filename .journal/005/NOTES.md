## 2026-06-23 12:21 — Kickoff
Goal for the session: not yet stated. Session opened via `session-new`;
awaiting the user's actual request.

Current state of the world:
- `master` is at `18b56e7` — the hexagonal Go API-server template with the
  PostgreSQL persistence tier merged (PR #6). Working tree clean except untracked
  `.claude/` and `.codex-security/`.
- Architecture as built: chi v5 + Huma v2 (transport-scoped, code-first
  OpenAPI 3.0.3); pragmatic ports & adapters; domain `internal/todo`; adapters
  under `internal/adapter/{memory,http,postgres}` (+ `http/middleware`,
  `http/problem`, `http/todoapi`); `internal/{config,observability,logctx,app,
  cli,integration}`; slog + Prometheus `/metrics` on a dedicated listener
  (`--metrics-addr`, default `:9090`); RFC 9457 on every non-Huma surface;
  OpenAPI exported server-less → neoteroi OAD render with a `root:check`
  drift-guard.
- Persistence: `--store=memory|postgres` (memory default); pgx/v5 + sqlc
  (committed + drift-guarded) + goose (embedded, `migrate` subcommand) + a
  testcontainers integration suite under `internal/integration` (build-tagged
  `integration`, run via `moon run root:test-integration`).
- Future-slice seams left open (not built): authn/authz; OTel tracing; rate
  limiting; pagination; API versioning; mockery. Known follow-up: wire
  `test-integration` into CI once the `.disabled` GitHub workflows get a
  Docker-capable runner.
- NOTE: session 004 did all the PostgreSQL work above but was never formally
  closed (no `SUMMARY.md`; still shows `in-progress` in `INDEX.md`). Flagged to
  the user at kickoff of 005.

Plan: wait for the user's request, then scope the work and proceed per
`.session.md`.
