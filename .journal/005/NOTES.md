## 2026-06-23 12:21 — Kickoff
Goal for the session: not yet stated. Session opened via `session-new`;
awaiting the user's actual request.

Current state of the world:
- `master` is at `18b56e7` — the hexagonal Go API-server template with the
  PostgreSQL persistence tier merged (PR #6). Working tree clean except untracked
  `.claude/` and `.codex-security/`.
- Architecture as built: chi v5 + Huma v2 (transport-scoped, code-first
  OpenAPI 3.0.3); pragmatic ports & adapters; domain `internal/todo`; adapters
  under `internal/adapter/{memory,http,postgres}` (+ `http/middleware`,
  `http/problem`, `http/todoapi`); `internal/{config,observability,logctx,app,
  cli,integration}`; slog + Prometheus `/metrics` on a dedicated listener
  (`--metrics-addr`, default `:9090`); RFC 9457 on every non-Huma surface;
  OpenAPI exported server-less → neoteroi OAD render with a `root:check`
  drift-guard.
- Persistence: `--store=memory|postgres` (memory default); pgx/v5 + sqlc
  (committed + drift-guarded) + goose (embedded, `migrate` subcommand) + a
  testcontainers integration suite under `internal/integration` (build-tagged
  `integration`, run via `moon run root:test-integration`).
- Future-slice seams left open (not built): authn/authz; OTel tracing; rate
  limiting; pagination; API versioning; mockery. Known follow-up: wire
  `test-integration` into CI once the `.disabled` GitHub workflows get a
  Docker-capable runner.
- NOTE: session 004 did all the PostgreSQL work above but was never formally
  closed (no `SUMMARY.md`; still shows `in-progress` in `INDEX.md`). Flagged to
  the user at kickoff of 005.

Plan: wait for the user's request, then scope the work and proceed per
`.session.md`.

## 2026-06-23 12:41 — Goal set: deep research on authorization middleware for the template
User's request: run a deep-research report on the modern (2024–2026) Go
ecosystem for an **authorization** starting point in the template. This feeds
the open "authn/authz" future-slice seam — but reframed: authentication is
deliberately **deferred** to the template user (JWT/Passkey/OIDC/session), and
the template instead provides a loosely-coupled, morphable **authorization
middleware seam** between API endpoints. Explicitly do NOT build from scratch —
discover, inventory, and rank existing Go options. Minimal assumptions about the
principal/identity model.

Refined scope via 3 clarifying questions (user answers):
- Authz model: **survey ALL paradigms then rank** — RBAC/scope, policy-as-code
  (cedar-go, OPA/Rego, Casbin, Oso), relationship-based/Zanzibar (OpenFGA,
  SpiceDB, Permify, Topaz/Aserto).
- Coupling: **in-process / embeddable only** — engine runs in the binary (zero
  infra, mirrors the in-memory store default); external services acceptable only
  behind a port/adapter.
- Authn scope: **include authn-verifier reference examples** (JWT — jwx/
  golang-jwt; OIDC — coreos/go-oidc) as integration-seam references, with
  authorization staying the primary focus.
- Also asked the report to cover chi v5 + Huma v2 middleware integration
  (per-route/per-operation authz) and a minimal principal-via-context model.

Action: launched the `deep-research` workflow — run `wf_9380176c-9e0`, task
`wx0d47prv`. Awaiting the synthesized cited report. This is a DESIGN-input
research step, not yet a build (keep design separate per
`separate-mechanical-from-design-work`).

Pending loose end (not blocking): an uncommitted working-tree edit to
`.journal/INDEX.md` reverts session 004's row back to `in-progress`, contradicting
its committed close (`749ddb1`) + `SUMMARY.md`. Flagged to user; recommended
`git restore .journal/INDEX.md`. Awaiting confirmation before touching it (the
harness flagged the change as intentional).

## 2026-06-23 12:52 — Research complete; report saved
`deep-research` run `wf_9380176c-9e0` finished (5 angles · 20 sources · 97 claims
→ top 25 verified → 24 confirmed / 1 refuted · 102 agents). Full report saved →
`.journal/005/RESEARCH-authz-middleware.md`.

Headline: define an **authz-decision port** (allow/deny) + wire it as **Huma v2
middleware** consuming an **opaque principal carried via context**. Verified
ranking by coupling: (1) **cedar-go** (AWS Cedar official Go lib, Apache-2.0,
pure in-process, synchronous PARC `Authorize` → Decision/Diagnostic) =
recommended default; (2) **embedded OPA** (`opa/v1/rego`, in-process but Go-only,
engine upgrade = redeploy) = runner-up; (3) **OpenFGA** (Zanzibar/ReBAC,
embeddable but heavy) = behind a port only. cedar-go/`rego.Eval`/OpenFGA
`server.Check` all satisfy one port shape → engine swappable. Huma seam:
`func(ctx huma.Context, next …)` via `api.UseMiddleware` or per-op
`Operation.Middlewares`; read `ctx.Operation().Security`; short-circuit 401/403
via `huma.WriteErr`; principal via `huma.WithValue` / `Resolver` (maintainer-
endorsed, issue #224). Authn deferred to drop-in verifiers (jwx, coreos/go-oidc,
go-chi/jwtauth, auth0/go-jwt-middleware v3).

**Coverage gap flagged:** Casbin, Cerbos, SpiceDB, Permify, Topaz/Aserto, Oso were
in scope but produced NO verified claims — the "survey all" inventory is
incomplete. Casbin (popular embeddable Go authz lib) + Cerbos (embeddable Go SDK)
are the notable omissions to fill before locking a design decision.

Next: this is DESIGN-input research, not a build. Awaiting the user's direction on
whether to (a) close the Casbin/Cerbos/etc. gap with a follow-up research pass,
and/or (b) move to collaborative design of the authz port + Huma middleware seam
(keep design separate from mechanical build per
`separate-mechanical-from-design-work`).

## 2026-06-23 13:05 — Gap-fill research complete (the six uncovered engines)
User chose "close the Casbin/Cerbos gap first." Ran 2nd `deep-research` run
`wf_0cf09b78-afe` (5 angles · 23 sources · 106 claims → 24 confirmed / 1 refuted ·
105 agents). Findings appended to `.journal/005/RESEARCH-authz-middleware.md`
("UPDATE — Gap-fill pass").

Verified (high confidence):
- **Casbin** = true in-process embeddable Go lib (`casbin/casbin/v2`,
  `Enforce → (bool,error)`), Apache-2.0 (no red flags, ASF incubating), PERM
  metamodel config (ACL/RBAC/RBAC-domains/ABAC/RESTful), mature (v2.135.0 Dec
  2025, ~1806 importers). = **strongest in-process peer to cedar-go**, above
  OPA/OpenFGA on embeddability; credible alternative default but does NOT displace
  cedar-go. Minor cost: ABAC leaks struct/reflection into matcher config.
- **Cerbos** = NOT a supported in-process Go option. Embedded (WASM) ePDP is
  JS/TS-only AND needs the commercial Cerbos Hub; the Go SDK is a client to an
  external/sidecar PDP. → behind-a-port only; disqualified for the zero-infra
  default. Does NOT change cedar-go-as-default.

Directional only (budget-dropped again; primary sources fetched but not 3-vote
verified): **SpiceDB**/**Permify** = Zanzibar gRPC servers → behind-a-port;
**Topaz/Aserto** = OPA+directory sidecar → behind-a-port; **Oso OSS (`go-oso`)** =
DEPRECATED for hosted Oso Cloud → disqualified.

Consolidated ranking: Tier 1 in-process libs = cedar-go (default) · Casbin (peer)
· embedded OPA; Tier 2 = OpenFGA (behind port); Tier 3 service-only = Cerbos/
SpiceDB/Permify/Topaz; disqualified = Oso OSS. **Real default fork = cedar-go vs
Casbin** (both verified, Apache-2.0, in-process; differ on authoring model).

Next: gap is closed for the decision that matters. Teed up to user: optional 3rd
pass to formally verify the four ReBAC/deprecated engines, vs move to
collaborative design (cedar-go vs Casbin default + the authz port + Huma seam).
Design stays separate from build per `separate-mechanical-from-design-work`.

## 2026-06-23 13:47 — DECISION: commit to Cedar (cedar-go), no portability layer
Collaborated through the cedar-go vs Casbin fork. User chose to be **opinionated**:
ship **Cedar via `cedar-go` as THE authorization engine**, drop the engine-
portability boundary (no neutral Decision interface, no compatibility layer with
other engines) — while keeping hexagonal hygiene. Rationale: the neutral port was
the most expensive / least useful boundary; committing lets us expose Cedar's real
API (typed Request, `Diagnostic` reasons, `.cedar` policy files) instead of a lossy
LCD `bool` port, drops a DTO mapping layer, and improves the test story. Boundaries
KEPT (not engine-portability): authn→authz handoff via opaque principal/claims in
context; `EntityGetter` for entity sourcing (Cedar's own interface — trivial/empty
for the coarse default, repo-backed for fine-grained later); domain (`internal/todo`)
stays Cedar-free; one thin app-owned `internal/authz` package speaks Cedar.

Design notes settled in discussion:
- Resource-level authz (needs the loaded resource) lives in the DOWNSTREAM
  handler/service — NOT day-one; coarse middleware default (principal + claims-as-
  context + route action, no entity graph) ships first. User confirmed this framing.
- The "entity graph" problem (Cedar needs entity attributes + parent/hierarchy
  edges to evaluate `resource.owner == principal` / `principal in Group`) only
  bites for fine-grained rules → documented `EntityGetter` extension point, not the
  default.

De-risking check (subagent, grounded in pkg.go.dev + repo README/releases):
**cedar-go v1.8.0 (2026-06-01)**, single v1 module, official AWS org, ~monthly
cadence. CORE LOOP IS FULLY STABLE (non-`x/`): `NewPolicySetFromBytes`/
`NewPolicyListFromBytes` (+ runtime-mutable `PolicySet`); `cedar.Authorize(policies,
entities, req) (Decision, Diagnostic)` (old `IsAuthorized` deprecated); `types.
EntityGetter`/`types.EntityMap`, `Entity{UID,Parents,Attributes,Tags}`;
`Diagnostic{Reasons[],Errors[]}` (reasons carry deciding `PolicyID`); JSON + all
core value types. GAPS (all advanced, NOT day-one): schema validation 🧪
experimental (`x/exp/schema`); policy templates ❌; full residual partial-eval ❌
(only experimental batch var-substitution); policy formatter ❌. Verdict: safe
commitment for the middleware starting point.

Next: move to COLLABORATIVE DESIGN of the authz seam (capture in a design doc à la
session 004's POSTGRES_TIER.md, then a gated build). First/biggest design fork to
settle = HOW the developer EXPRESSES per-endpoint authorization (the UX) — Huma
`Security` scheme-name convention vs a custom per-operation action/resource
declaration the middleware maps into a Cedar request.

## 2026-06-23 14:43 — Design converged; AUTHZ_TIER.md drafted; PAUSED for review
Collaborated through the full design across several forks; all captured in
`.journal/005/AUTHZ_TIER.md` (journal-only, source of truth, mirrors POSTGRES_TIER.md).
Converged decisions:
- **Modular from day one** (user confirmed): per-slice authz contributions (policies +
  action constants + lazy fact resolver), merged by the composition root into one
  `PolicySet` + one composite `EntityGetter` — mirrors the HTTP registrar seam. Base
  `internal/authz` holds engine plumbing + cross-cutting policies + shared principal
  types; `internal/todo/todoauthz` is the todo slice; `todoapi` consumes its actions.
- **Expression UX:** `authz.Require(action[, idParam])` / `authz.Public()` set Huma
  operation Metadata; ONE global Huma middleware enforces (reconciled from per-op
  middleware → global, to get deny-default). Require also populates OpenAPI `Security`.
- **Deny-by-default** for Huma operations (undeclared → 403 + warn). Infra routes are
  raw chi, outside the Huma authz mw.
- **URL-fed resource identity** (user's idea): middleware sets `Request.Resource =
  Todo::"<id>"` from the path param, no load → identity/principal-based instance authz
  in middleware.
- **Lazy request-scoped fact resolvers** (user's idea): composite `EntityGetter` bound
  to request ctx (claims+repos), loads on demand; Cedar pulls only what policies
  dereference. Two rules from the pull interface (`Get(uid)(Entity,bool)`, no ctx/err):
  bind ctx at construction; capture first load error → 500 fail-closed; cache per
  request (N+1). This pulls the attribute-based case back into middleware as an option
  (double-load caveat; coarse default never triggers it).
- Smaller forks settled (proposed): naming `Action::"todo:create"` + PascalCase types
  + slice-prefixed policy IDs; double-load = none day-one (coarse), cache shipped.

**ONE decision flagged for the user (security stakes): §8C day-one authn default** —
dev authenticator ON by default (best demo, copy-to-prod footgun) vs OFF by default
(safest; out-of-box protected routes 401). Recommended ON-with-guardrails but
explicitly deferred to the user.

cedar-go is a plain `go get` dep (no Proto tooling, unlike sqlc/goose). Build phasing
in doc §12: A base package → B todo slice+wiring → C tests → D docs; branch
`feat/authz-tier`, gated PR. PAUSED for user review of AUTHZ_TIER.md before any build.

## 2026-06-23 14:52 — Review nit: slice package naming
User: `todo/todoauthz` is redundant → use `todo/authz` (cleaner; will align the HTTP
layer's `todoapi`→`todo/http` separately, later). Updated AUTHZ_TIER.md §2: slice dir
is now `internal/todo/authz` (`package authz`). Consequence handled in doc: base engine
is also `package authz`, so the composition root + `todoapi` alias the slice import
(`todoauthz "…/internal/todo/authz"`) — dir stays clean, `todoauthz.X` in examples is
just that alias. Cedar-free-domain rule still holds (dep runs slice→core only). Still
paused for review; §8C (dev-auth default) remains the open user decision.

## 2026-06-23 14:59 — Day-one authn: API-key layer (supersedes dev-header)
User proposed a rudimentary, mostly-hardcoded **API-key** layer as the day-one
authn/authz solution, caveated as not-real + trivial to remove. Endorsed — it's better
than the `X-Dev-*` header dev-authenticator: a real credential (not pure impersonation,
so smaller copy-to-prod risk), doubles as a plausible hardenable starting point, still
trivial to remove, and demonstrates allow/deny end-to-end (no key→401, user key→allowed,
missing role→403, admin key→everything). Drops into the existing `Authenticator` seam —
nothing else in the design changes. Two impl rules baked in: never log the key (redact
`Authorization`/`X-API-Key` in the access log); day-one = plain map lookup, hashing +
constant-time compare as the DELETE_ME hardening path.

Folded into AUTHZ_TIER.md (§7 authenticator, §8C resolution, §9 `--api-keys` config,
§10/§12 build, §13). §8C reframed: the remaining (smaller-stakes) open decision is
whether **built-in dev keys ship** — recommended: ship a tiny user+admin default set for
zero-config demo WITH a loud warning + `--api-keys` override + DELETE_ME #1 removal
(honors "mostly hardcoded"); safer variant = no default keys (protected routes 401 out
of box). Still paused for user's pick on that sub-decision before the build.

## 2026-06-23 17:06 — Synced sessions 006-008 (user-implemented); impact on AUTHZ_TIER
While 005 was paused the user shipped 006 (PR #7), 007 (PR #8), 008 (PR #9). Read their
SUMMARYs + updated TECH_NOTES. They SIMPLIFY the authz proposal (core design unchanged):
- **008 PostgreSQL-only** (`8a46286`): `memory` adapter + `--store` toggle REMOVED;
  `--database-url` required. → My APIKeyStore two-adapter (config+postgres) reconciliation
  and the "preserve zero-infra `go run` authz demo" concern are MOOT — there's no memory
  mode. API keys live in postgres, single path. Also: **mockery** adopted for test
  doubles (Proto-pinned, `.mockery.yaml`, generated mock + `mockery-check` drift guard) →
  new authz ports (Authenticator, APIKeyStore, EntityResolver) use mockery doubles.
  `app.New(ctx,cfg,logger,version,...Option)` + `app.WithRepository` injection seam.
- **006 Docker Compose** (`8b68bd4`): `compose up` runs postgres→migrate→seed→api on an
  EPHEMERAL DB; drop-in `hack/sql/*.sql` seeds applied AFTER migrations by a psql one-shot
  (explicitly NOT migrations, NOT the postgres init-dir). → "day one = compose up" is BUILT
  (not future). The user's `99999_MOCK_API_KEYS.sql` *migration* idea is SUPERSEDED by the
  better, already-built pattern: api_keys TABLE → goose migration (schema, shared
  `internal/adapter/postgres/migrations`); mock KEYS → `hack/sql/` seed (data, dev-only,
  ephemeral → never reaches a real deploy). This RESOLVES §8C safely-by-construction (a
  migration would run in prod too — exactly the footgun 006 avoided).
- **007 per-domain layout** (`1f1e5a7`): adapters nested under the domain —
  `internal/todo/{httpapi,postgres}`; shared infra stays `internal/adapter/{http,postgres}`.
  → doc's `todoapi` becomes `httpapi`; the `todo/authz` slice is consistent; the base-vs-
  slice `authz` package-name collision matches the established `todopostgres` alias
  precedent (alias the slice `todoauthz`). The user's earlier "I'll fix todoapi later" =
  DONE (it's `httpapi` now).

Proposing doc edits to sync (no design change): per-domain paths + httpapi + alias note;
API-key store = postgres-backed (drop config/two-adapter + `--api-keys`); api_keys table
migration + `hack/sql/` mock-keys seed; §8C resolved via dev-only seed; mockery for new
ports; remove `--store`. Awaiting user go-ahead to apply, then build.

## 2026-06-23 17:20 — AUTHZ_TIER.md synced to 006-008 (user: "Proceed")
Applied all sync edits to AUTHZ_TIER.md (status now "synced to PRs #7–#9 / sessions
006–008"). Changes (no design change, core spine intact): §1.2 authn = API-key backed by
postgres `api_keys` table + `hack/sql/` mock seed; §2 layout redrawn to per-domain
(`internal/todo/{httpapi,postgres,authz}`, base `internal/authz`, `internal/authz/apikey`,
`api_keys` migration under shared `internal/adapter/postgres/migrations`, `hack/sql/` seed)
+ `todopostgres`→`todoauthz` alias precedent + mockery note; §4/§5 `httpapi`; §7 API-key
authenticator = `APIKeyStore` port + postgres adapter (3 impl rules incl. mockery); §8C
RESOLVED (table-migration + dev-only seed = safe by construction; no open sub-decision);
§9 dropped `--api-keys` (keys in DB); §10/§12 ships+phasing updated (migration, store
adapter, mockery, seed in Phase D); §13 dropped the §8C item, added base-package-home
placement note. Committed + pushed.

Doc is now build-ready. Remaining items are Phase-A feasibility checks (Huma path-param
accessor; cedar-go on-demand `Get`) + the minor `internal/authz` vs `internal/adapter/authz`
home — none blocking. NEXT: on user's go, kick off the gated build, Phase A, on branch
`feat/authz-tier` (own worktree off fetched master, squash-merged PR; human gate per phase).

## 2026-06-23 17:27 — Build started: Phase A workflow launched (user: "LGTM. Proceed")
Created impl worktree `feat/authz-tier` off `origin/master` (`8a46286`, postgres-only) at
`.wt/feat-authz-tier`. Launched gated Phase A workflow `implement-authz-phase-a` (run
`wf_c627ba40-aa0`, task `w78akg3th`): implement → 3 adversarial reviewers (correctness /
doc-adherence / conventions) → fix → validate, all operating IN the impl worktree with
`AUTHZ_TIER.md` as source of truth (read from the journal worktree). Key guardrails baked
into the workflow: agents work only in `.wt/feat-authz-tier` (never the journal/master
worktrees, no `.journal/` edits); commit with `--no-gpg-sign` (background can't touch the
yubikey; squashed at PR time anyway); keep `moon run root:check` green; **Phase A defaults
`--authz-enabled=false`** so deny-default + empty contributions don't 403 the untagged
existing routes (Phase B tags routes + flips to true); API-key store = hand-written pgx vs
the api_keys migration (no 2nd sqlc pkg); mockery for the new ports. Awaiting completion →
human gate before Phase B.

## 2026-06-23 18:06 — Phase A COMPLETE (gate 1); root:check green, independently verified
Workflow `wf_c627ba40-aa0` done (6 agents). Two commits on `feat/authz-tier`:
`edc53c1` (implement) + `752a69d` (fix). **I independently re-ran** `go build ./...` +
`go vet ./...` + `go test ./...` in the worktree → all exit 0, every unit test passes
(incl. `internal/authz` + `internal/authz/apikey`). The IDE `BrokenImport`/not-in-workspace
diagnostics are the known `.wt`+go.work false-positive — dismissed. Built: base
`internal/authz` (Authorizer/PolicySet-merge, Contribution model, Principal+ctx,
Authenticator seam, lazy request-scoped getter w/ ctx-bound error sink + per-req cache,
Require/Public declarations, global deny-default middleware w/ 401/403/500 RFC9457,
always-present principal-resolver projecting role claims→entity parents for the admin
override, embedded base.cedar), `internal/authz/apikey` (X-API-Key/Bearer Authenticator +
APIKeyStore port + hand-written pgx postgres adapter), `00002_create_api_keys.sql`
migration, `--authz-enabled`/`--authz-policy-dir` config, app wiring (empty contribution
set), mockery doubles for all 3 new ports, focused unit tests. Base authz home finalized
at `internal/authz` (resolves design open-Q4).

Reviewers (3 lenses): 19 findings, 4 blocker/major = 2 real pairs, BOTH FIXED in `752a69d`:
(1) `--authz-policy-dir` was a silent no-op → wired `authz.WithPolicyDir` + `loadBasePolicies`
(fails startup on missing/empty/invalid dir, no silent embedded fallback); (2) `Require()`
didn't populate OpenAPI `Security` (Metadata is `yaml:"-"`) → added `ApplySecurity(api)` pass
(post-registration, sets `op.Security`), called from `Install()`, asserted in generated YAML.
Good minors also fixed: `decisionAllow` was the zero-value (latent fail-open) → reordered so
zero = `decisionError` + fail-closed default; comment-hygiene (stripped all §/Phase/DELETE_ME
refs from godoc); `go mod tidy` (cedar-go now direct); `WithPrincipal` wired (was dead);
Authorize/app/apikey godoc fixes.

CARRY-FORWARD (deferred, surfaced to user):
- **getter byType overwrite (Phase B)**: a slice resolver owning the principal's entity
  type (`User`) would shadow the principal resolver → silently break the admin override.
  MUST handle in Phase B (principal-type precedence / merge resolvers).
- **sqlc `ApiKey` bleed**: api_keys in the shared migrations dir → sqlc emits an unused
  `ApiKey` struct into the TODO sqlc package. Harmless/clean per sqlc-check; documented in
  apikey pkg doc. Accept vs scope-sqlc-to-todo-tables = user call.
- `--authz-enabled=false` Phase-A default (design §9 updated to note the deferral; Phase B
  flips to true).
Branch held local (not pushed); PR at end of phases. PAUSED for gate-1 approval → Phase B.

## 2026-06-23 18:16 — sqlc bleed resolved: omit_unused_structs (verified)
User chose to fix (not accept) the sqlc `ApiKey` bleed. Verified `omit_unused_structs` is
a real sqlc Go-gen option via context7 (sqlc docs: "prevents sqlc from generating structs
for tables and enums that are not referenced in any queries within a package"). Applied
directly (self-verifying tooling): added `omit_unused_structs: true` to `sqlc.yaml`'s
go gen block, ran `moon run sqlc`. Before: models.go had `ApiKey` + `Todo`; AFTER: only
`Todo`. Diff is exactly models.go (−6, the ApiKey struct) + sqlc.yaml (+6) — no other
generated files touched. `moon run root:sqlc-check` green (no drift), `go build ./...`
exit 0, full `moon run root:check` green (10 tasks). Committed `138d8e9` on
`feat/authz-tier`. Bonus realized: the api_keys migration now produces ZERO todo-sqlc
output, so feature removal is truly surgical (no todo regen needed). AUTHZ_TIER.md §2
updated to record the decision. Branch now 3 commits (edc53c1, 752a69d, 138d8e9).
Gate-1's one open item is resolved → ready for full Phase B on approval.

## 2026-06-23 18:23 — Phase B build launched (user: "Proceed with Phase B")
Launched gated Phase B workflow `implement-authz-phase-b` (run `wf_b958c5e4-a85`, task
`wyglw2qjs`) on `feat/authz-tier` (reviewBase `138d8e9` so reviewers focus on the Phase B
diff). Same implement → 3 reviewers → fix → validate structure + guardrails. Phase B scope
in the prompt: `internal/todo/authz` slice (actions, coarse `policy.cedar` granting a role
the todo actions + base admin override + a commented attribute-policy example, repo-backed
fact resolver mapping Todo→entity using EXISTING fields only — no domain change/owner field);
tag `httpapi` routes via the `todoauthz` alias with `Require(action[,"todoID"])`; implement
URL-id→Resource binding in the middleware; wire `Contribution(repo)` in app.go; the
**principal-type precedence fix** (authz.New errors on duplicate entity-type ownership, principal
type reserved); flip `--authz-enabled` default→true with a new `app.WithAuthenticator` test
seam + update existing httpapi/app tests to authenticate (NOT weaken authz); ensure the
server-less OpenAPI export applies Security and refresh/commit the spec (openapi-check).
Two feasibility items to confirm in-flight: Huma path-param at middleware; cedar-go lazy Get.
Awaiting completion → gate-2.

## 2026-06-23 18:58 — Phase B COMPLETE (gate 2); green, independently verified
Workflow `wf_b958c5e4-a85` done (6 agents). Branch `feat/authz-tier` now 6 commits:
edc53c1, 752a69d, 138d8e9 (phase A + sqlc), then e63902d (precedence fix + URL-id binding +
install/finalize split), 73370c8 (todo authz slice + route tagging + enable), 299525d (phase
B review fixes). **I independently re-ran** `go build`/`go vet`/`go test ./...` (all pass),
confirmed `defaultAuthzEnabled = true`, the committed `docs/docs/openapi.yaml` carries the
`apiKey` securityScheme + `- apiKey: []` on all 4 todo ops, and full `moon run root:check`
green (10 tasks). IDE BrokenImport = go.work false-positive, dismissed.

Shipped: `internal/todo/authz` slice (actions `Action::"todo:*"`; coarse `policy.cedar`
granting `Role::"user"` the todo actions + admin via base + commented attribute-policy
example; repo-backed lazy fact resolver mapping Todo→entity from EXISTING fields only).
Routes tagged via `todoauthz` alias; by-id ops bind `{id}`→`Resource = Todo::"<id>"`.
Contribution wired in app.go. Precedence fix (static `Contribution.Types`; `New` errors on
duplicate/reserved-type ownership). `--authz-enabled` flipped→true with `app.WithAuthenticator`
test seam (tests authenticate, authz NOT weakened). OpenAPI export stamps security
independent of the runtime flag. Feasibility confirmed: `huma.Context.Param` works at
middleware; cedar-go `Get` is lazy.

TWO STANDOUT CATCHES:
- **Latent enforcement bug (implementer-found):** Huma snapshots `api.Middlewares()` into each
  op at `huma.Register` time, so the old "register routes THEN install authz" order meant
  authz NEVER RAN (silent bypass) — caught by a new deny test returning 201. Fixed by
  splitting `Install` (pre-register, UseMiddleware) / `Finalize` (post-register, security
  docs); router installs before Register, finalizes after.
- **Custom-principal regression (review-found, MAJOR, fixed):** the precedence fix routed the
  principal resolver by static `{User,Anonymous}`, so a custom Authenticator minting a
  non-User type (the documented WithAuthenticator/JWT/OIDC seam) → principal entity silently
  unresolved → role parents never projected → every `principal in Role` fails → blanket 403.
  Fixed: register the principal resolver under the actual `p.UID.Type` too, with a
  `principalFirst` chain so a slice owning that type still serves its own instances
  (principal resolver only matches its own bound UID). Regression tests added.
Review also fixed: error when a Resolver has empty Types; apikey uses `authz.PrincipalType`
(single source); undeclared op → 403 (not 401). Deferred nits (reasonable): empty-id
fallback warning; `ActionDelete` declared but no delete route (full CRUD vocab — optional
trim); two NewMiddleware instances (not a defect).

Minor decision worth a user nod: complete-todo → `ActionUpdate`; `{id}` param (not the
doc's illustrative `{todoID}`); `ActionDelete` declared w/o a route. Branch held local.
PAUSED for gate-2 → Phase C (container-backed integration + functional allow/deny).

## 2026-06-23 19:04 — Gate 2 approved ("LGTM. Proceed."); Phase C launched
User approved Phase B; ActionDelete kept as-is (full CRUD vocab). Launched gated Phase C
workflow `implement-authz-phase-c` (run `wf_415d45a2-0ee`, task `w4clvziyw`) on
`feat/authz-tier` (reviewBase `299525d`). Scope: container-backed integration tests in
`internal/integration` — (1) the REAL postgres `APIKeyStore`/Authenticator (insert api_keys
rows, resolve → principal+roles, unknown→miss, roles[] parsing); (2) end-to-end functional
authz through the FULL stack with authz ENABLED + the real postgres authenticator (no
key→401, user key→allowed CRUD, insufficient role→403, admin→allowed via base, URL-id
instance binding on a by-id route). Default `go test ./...` stays hermetic (tag-gated).
Review lens tuned for the TEST-phase risk = false greens (stub/disabled authz, allow/deny
not distinguished, container not used). Validate runs BOTH `root:check` and
`test-integration` (real container; Docker worked in session 004's workflow). Awaiting
completion → gate-3.

## 2026-06-23 19:20 — Phase C COMPLETE (gate 3); container suite green, independently verified
Workflow `wf_415d45a2-0ee` done (5 agents); 0 blocker/major. Commit `e12f76d` added
`internal/integration/apikey_store_test.go` (TestAPIKeyStoreAdapter, 6 subtests — REAL
postgres APIKeyStore + Authenticator: subject/roles[] parsing, unknown→miss-not-error,
exact PK match, empty-roles→empty slice, X-API-Key→Principal, unknown→ErrInvalidKey) and
`internal/integration/authz_e2e_test.go` (TestAuthzEndToEnd, 6 subtests — FULL stack via
app.New, authz ENABLED, real postgres authenticator, NO stubs: no cred→401, guest role→403,
user key→2xx CRUD/list/get/complete, admin→allowed via base, Bearer also works, unknown→401),
plus a `ResetPool` fixture helper. Default `go test ./...` stays hermetic (tag-gated).
**I independently re-ran** `go test -count=1 -tags integration ./internal/integration/...`
→ real postgres:17-alpine container, PASS (14.3s); `moon run root:check` green.

Review: 7 findings, 0 blocker/major (fix step skipped). I applied the 3 worthwhile quality
fixes myself (commit `3728663`): dropped two "the design" references from test comments
(repo convention = no design-doc refs in code) and corrected the e2e godoc/inline comment
that overstated it "proves" Cedar URL-id binding (the coarse policy is resource-agnostic, so
the genuine binding proof is the unit `TestMiddlewareBindsURLIDToResource`; reworded + pointed
to it). Re-verified: `go vet -tags integration` + `moon run root:check` green.

Deferred nits (harmless, mentioned to user): e2e leaks app's pgx pool (would need a prod
App.Close API for a test-only short-lived leak); deny subtests assert status not the RFC9457
body (layer ordering already rules out a 404/422 masquerade); no full-stack public/undeclared
e2e route (covered at the middleware layer — TestMiddlewareAllowsPublicOperation /
DeniesUndeclaredOperation — would need synthetic routes).

Branch `feat/authz-tier` = 8 commits, held local. PAUSED for gate-3 → Phase D (docs +
`hack/sql` mock-keys seed + README/DELETE_ME + docs/index) then squash-merge PR.

## 2026-06-23 19:25 — Gate 3 approved ("LGTM"); Phase D (final) launched
Launched gated Phase D workflow `implement-authz-phase-d` (run `wf_19a23100-9f7`, task
`w32tnxu0z`) on `feat/authz-tier` (reviewBase `3728663`). Scope: dev-only
`hack/sql/0002_seed_api_keys.sql` mock-keys seed (user+admin roles matching the policy;
loud INSECURE/dev-only/ephemeral comment; ON CONFLICT like 0001); README Authorization
section + the modular per-resource authz-slice pattern + compose demo with the seeded keys;
DELETE_ME removal recipe ("replace the API-key authn" = #1; full surgical-removal list +
the omit_unused_structs no-regen note); docs/index quickstart with authz on; `moon run
openapi` (expect no drift, security committed in B). CAPSTONE: a real `docker compose up
--build` functional check of the day-one demo (no key→401, dev-user-key→200, create→201,
admin→200) then `down -v`. Review lens tuned for the docs-phase risk = INACCURACY (flag/
header/route/key/role/curl must match code; the prior repo docs phase shipped a /readyz
shape bug — don't repeat). Validate = root:check + doc/code consistency (no recompose).
Awaiting completion → gate-4 → then open the squash-merge PR.

## 2026-06-23 19:44 — Phase D COMPLETE (gate 4 — all phases done); ready for PR
Workflow `wf_19a23100-9f7` done (5 agents); 0 blocker/major. Commit `37634b1` added
`hack/sql/0002_seed_api_keys.sql` (dev-user-key/role user, dev-admin-key/role admin; loud
INSECURE/dev-only header; ON CONFLICT), README "Authorization" section + modular per-resource
pattern + config table/layout rows, DELETE_ME removal recipe (replace-the-API-key-authn #1 +
full surgical list + no-sqlc-regen note), docs/index quickstart with authz on. **CAPSTONE
compose check ran live**: `docker compose up --build` → postgres→migrate→seed→api healthy,
both keys seeded, observed: no cred→401, X-API-Key:dev-user-key→200, POST→201, admin→200,
unknown→401, Bearer→200, by-id get/complete→200; then `down -v`. `moon run openapi` no drift.

Review: 5 findings, 0 blocker/major. I applied the 3 worthwhile ones (commit `bf0b9aa`):
(1) `apikey.go` package doc was stale — claimed removal regenerates the todo sqlc package,
which contradicts our DELETE_ME and is empirically false (omit_unused_structs) → corrected;
(2) README create-response example showed `completedAt:null` but the real DTO omits it
(omitempty) + has `$schema` → corrected; (3) `compose.yaml` header curl returned 401 under
authz-on → added the `X-API-Key` header. Left the seed's loud `-- ####` banner (intentional
warning for committed mock creds). Re-verified: `go build`/`vet` + `moon run root:check` green.

WHOLE TIER (independently verified across phases): branch `feat/authz-tier` = **10 commits,
+3997/−33, 49 files**. root:check green; build/vet/all unit tests green; integration suite
green vs real postgres:17-alpine (14.3s, my re-run in Phase C); live compose day-one demo
green (Phase D). Cedar (cedar-go) embedded engine, no portability layer; modular per-domain
authz slices; deny-by-default Huma middleware (Install/Finalize split — fixes the latent
Huma middleware-snapshot bug); URL-id→Resource binding; lazy request-scoped fact getter;
API-key authn (postgres `api_keys`, X-API-Key/Bearer) as the replaceable deferred-authn seam;
`--authz-enabled` (default true) + `--authz-policy-dir`; OpenAPI security stamped. Domain
core untouched/Cedar-free; mockery for the new ports; omit_unused_structs keeps todo sqlc clean.

Branch held LOCAL (unsigned `--no-gpg-sign` intermediate commits — squashed at merge). PAUSED
for gate-4 approval → then push branch + `gh pr create` (squash-merge PR for the user's review).
Follow-up still open (unchanged): wire `test-integration` into CI once a Docker runner exists.

## 2026-06-23 19:48 — Gate 4 approved ("LGTM"); PR #10 opened, CI running
Pushed `feat/authz-tier` to origin and opened **PR #10**
(https://github.com/meigma/template-go-api/pull/10), base `master`, squash-merge, title
`feat(authz): add Cedar-based authorization tier with deferred API-key authn`. Body covers
design + the 4 gated phases + day-one demo + config + testing + removal + the CI follow-up.
Initial checks: ci/Pages/Kusari pending (release+container dry-runs skip on PRs as expected);
mergeable=MERGEABLE, mergeStateStatus=UNSTABLE (checks not done). Watching checks to
completion in the background (`gh pr checks 10 --watch`, bg id b3hrna1z4). Will report
pass/fail. Note: Kusari may flag new transitive CVEs/licenses (it did on PR #6 — x/crypto);
if it fails, inspect + pin like session 004 did, then re-run. Not merging — user reviews/merges.
