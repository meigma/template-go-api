title: New session — awaiting goal
started: 2026-06-27

## 2026-06-27 12:16 — Kickoff
Goal for the session: not yet stated. Session primed via `/session-new`; the
developer has not yet given a request. Title and scope will be refined on their
first message.

Current state of the world:
- Template is feature-complete on `master` (`3a10e80`); working tree clean.
- All previously-deferred feature seams are built (session 011): API versioning
  (`/v1`), per-IP rate limiting, OpenTelemetry tracing.
- Persistence is PostgreSQL-only (sqlc + pgx + goose); authz is Cedar
  deny-by-default with deferred API-key authn; day-one Docker Compose stack.
- Security review remediated (session 010): API keys hashed at rest, `GET /todos`
  keyset-paginated, sqlc binary integrity-pinned.
- Last session (014) was research-only: assessed moon docker / ko / buildpacks vs
  the hand-rolled `Dockerfile` — **no change made; container-image build strategy
  decision still deferred** (live fork: ko per-language vs buildpacks fleet-wide
  vs shared Dockerfile). See `.journal/014/SUMMARY.md` if that thread resumes.

Plan: await the developer's request, then refine the title/scope and journal
accordingly.

## 2026-06-27 12:20 — Goal stated: research dev-tooling swap
Developer wants to swap the template's dev tooling for a new stack centered on
three tools, building on session 014's deferred container-image decision:
- **mise** — manages ALL tooling (incl. the `moon` and `railpack` CLIs), replaces
  `.envrc`/direnv for env, and becomes the primary local task runner. (Replaces
  Proto pinning.)
- **moonrepo** — stays the primary CI runner / pre-PR gate / GHA entry point, but
  overridden to use **system** binaries so it uses mise-managed tooling.
- **Railpack** — replaces the bespoke `Dockerfile` as the image builder; ideally
  triggered by moon (needs investigation).
- **GoReleaser** — still needed for binary build/publish, but open to a
  cross-language alternative.

Open questions to answer in this research pass:
1. How do moon and Railpack integrate?
2. Do cross-platform (multi-arch) builds still work under Railpack?
3. How does Railpack integrate with the SBOM/supply-chain stack (Cosign, SLSA,
   GitHub attestations)?
4. Cross-language (non-Go) alternative to GoReleaser for producing/publishing
   binaries?

This pass is RESEARCH ONLY — understand the three tools and give preliminary
answers. Launched 4 parallel research agents (mise; moon+integration; Railpack;
GoReleaser alternatives), all instructed to ground claims in current docs (per
the `verify-tooling-support-claims` lesson from session 014). Synthesis to follow.

## 2026-06-27 12:35 — Research findings (4 agents)
Ground truth on current stack (read from source): tooling is **Proto**-pinned
(`.prototools` + `.moon/proto/*.toml`: golangci-lint, goose, mockery, sqlc; moon
tasks call `proto run <tool> -- …`). moon v2 `go` toolchain 1.26.4 + unstable
python/uv for docs. **No `.envrc`/direnv today** (mise's env role is additive).
CI = `moonrepo/setup-toolchain` → `moon ci`. Release bar is HIGH: `release.yml`
does multi-arch via **native arm64 runners** (not QEMU), BuildKit `sbom: true` +
`provenance: mode=max`, GitHub artifact attestations on image + checksums, image
is **distroless static-debian12:nonroot**, reproducible (`-trimpath -buildid=`,
`mod_timestamp`). The bespoke `sqlc-verify` task exists ONLY because sqlc ships no
upstream checksum.

**mise (strong fit).** Manages every tool we use: golangci-lint/mockery/sqlc/
goreleaser via `aqua:` (full checksum + Cosign + SLSA + GH-attestation in
`mise.lock`), goose via `aqua:pressly/goose`, moon via `aqua:moonrepo/moon`
(verify old `@moonrepo/cli` version-naming), railpack via `github:railwayapp/
railpack`. `mise.lock` is **opt-in** (`touch mise.lock` + install, or `mise lock`;
`locked = true` enforces) and records per-platform hashes + provenance for aqua/
github backends — EQUALS or BEATS Proto's `checksum-url` and **makes the bespoke
`sqlc-verify` task obsolete** (sqlc has checksum metadata in aqua-registry). Risk:
asdf/npm/cargo/pipx backends are version-only (no hash) — pin everything to
aqua/github. Env via `[env]`/`mise.local.toml`/`_.file` fully replaces .envrc for
our needs. Task runner (TOML/file tasks, depends, sources/outputs **mtime** not
content-hash, parallel-4) is simpler than moon — intended split: mise = local
runner, moon = CI gate. CI: `jdx/mise-action@v3` (install+cache) adds shims to
`$GITHUB_PATH` so moon finds tools on PATH. GOTCHA: shims inject PATH only, not
`[env]` vars — use `mise exec --` if env needed in CI.

**moon as system runner (clean, mechanical).** Use system binaries by **omitting
the `go:` toolchain block** (cleanest) and/or `MOON_TOOLCHAIN_FORCE_GLOBALS=true`,
and/or per-task `toolchains: system`. moon resolves task `command` from PATH
(v1.18+), so `proto run golangci-lint -- run …` → `golangci-lint run …`, etc.
No native moon↔mise / moon↔railpack integration — purely compositional (Railpack's
own README recommends installing it via mise). moon→Railpack = a task running
`railpack build .` with `cache: false` (image output, no file artifact). moon
docker layer = distraction (confirms session 014). CI swap: drop
`moonrepo/setup-toolchain`, use `jdx/mise-action` + install moon + `moon ci`;
affected-gating unchanged. GOTCHA: moon's task hash does NOT include system binary
versions → stale cache on a tool bump with unchanged source. Idiomatic fix
(already used here for `.prototools`): put `mise.toml`/`mise.lock` in task `inputs`
so a version bump invalidates the hash.

**Railpack (fights this template's posture).** Clears easy bars (Go auto-detect,
CLI-invocable, multi-arch exists) but MISSES three hard requirements: (1) runtime
is **debian:bookworm-slim, not distroless**, no nonroot user by default; (2)
multi-arch is **QEMU sequential per-platform + must push** (3–10× slower than the
current native Go cross-compile; no local multi-arch image); (3) **no built-in
SBOM/provenance/Cosign** — SLSA L3 not OOB; SBOM only via external Syft or
untested BuildKit-frontend passthrough; provenance via the same
`actions/attest-build-provenance` layer we already have. Also: no ldflags
passthrough (VERSION/COMMIT/DATE needs a `--build-cmd` override), **breaks
`docker compose up --build`** (not a docker-build drop-in → keep a thin
Dockerfile), buildkitd is a hard prereq, v0.30 sub-v1.0, only a community GHA
action. It's essentially the "buildpacks family" tradeoff from session 014
(zero-config cross-language, fatter/less-minimal, QEMU multi-arch).

**GoReleaser (keep — and it's already cross-language).** Not Go-locked since
v2.5–v2.9 (2025): OSS builders for Rust/Zig/Bun/Deno/Node/Python(uv,poetry) +
`pre-built` import. Already owns the full supply chain we use (Cosign v3 bundles,
SBOM, GH attestations, SLSA). `dist` (cargo-dist) is Rust-first w/ experimental
generic builds, better INSTALLER UX, but **lacks Cosign + SLSA** and SBOM is
Rust-only; axodotdev is a ~2-person company (continuity risk). No single
cross-language tool matches GoReleaser's integrated supply-chain stack. Verdict:
keep GoReleaser; it IS the cross-language binary tool (validate non-Go builders
under our Cosign/SBOM/attestation config before fleet-wide reuse).

Net read: mise + moon-as-system are clean, high-value swaps (mise's lockfile is a
genuine supply-chain upgrade and deletes `sqlc-verify`). Railpack is the weak link
— it regresses minimalism, multi-arch speed, and integrated SBOM/provenance for
this hardened template; its only real upside is fleet cross-language uniformity
(the same axis as buildpacks in session 014). GoReleaser stays. Decision on the
image builder still owed to the developer; mise+moon could proceed independently.

## 2026-06-27 13:05 — Fleet tangent: is there a `ko` for JS? + apko
Developer asked (cross-fleet context — they maintain non-Go templates too)
whether a `ko`-equivalent exists for JS (Vue/React/Node). Ran one grounded
research agent. Findings:
- **No JS-native ko-equivalent at maturity** — structural, not immaturity: ko
  works because Go → one static binary (`base + binary = image`). JS has no
  default single-artifact output. ko's real sibling is **Jib** (JVM); the "ko
  family" is Go + Java, NO Node member. Google's `nodejs-container-image-builder`
  was archived Sep 2025.
- **Frontend SPA = easy case**: artifact is static files → image is `tiny static
  server + dist/`. No one-shot tool, but only a ~10-line two-stage Dockerfile on
  a shared base: **Chainguard nginx** (apko-built, SBOM) or **static-web-server**
  (4 MB Rust binary).
- **Backend Node**: only "minimal" via compile-to-binary — **Bun** `build
  --compile` (stable, best; ~60–100 MB; glibc→`distroless/base`, not scratch;
  cross-compiles incl. musl), **Deno** `compile` (mature; ~58 MB), **Node SEA**
  (Stability 1.1, pre-stable — don't use yet), **vercel/pkg** (archived Jan 2024),
  **nexe** (unmaintained). All still need a one-line COPY; none is daemonless
  one-shot like ko.
- **apko (Chainguard)** is the cross-fleet thread: explicitly ko-inspired,
  daemonless, bitwise-reproducible, native SBOM, multi-arch — but at the
  BASE-IMAGE layer (declarative YAML, no Dockerfile, no RUN/COPY-from-host). Can't
  inject your app like ko injects a Go binary (would need melange to package the
  app as an apk). Pairs with melange (source→apk) over Wolfi.
- **Fleet takeaway** (reinforces the prior turn): don't chase "ko for every
  language." Anchor consistency at a shared **apko/Chainguard hardened base-image
  factory** + a thin per-language "get the artifact in" step (ko injects for Go;
  COPY onto a shared static-server base for SPAs; Bun-compile+COPY for Node). apko
  is the closest cross-language carrier of ko's *philosophy*. (Cute escape hatch
  for ko literally everywhere: a tiny Go static-server that `go:embed`s the SPA
  `dist/`, ko-built — couples the frontend image to a Go binary.)

## 2026-06-27 14:05 — Migration plan designed (workflow) + APPROVED; starting impl
Ran an exhaustive ultracode plan workflow (9 read-only agents: 3 Explore → 4 Plan
designs → 2 adversarial critiques). Goal confirmed by developer: **Proto→mise,
moon→system tooling, Dockerfile→melange/apko, GoReleaser stays, preserve/improve
supply chain.** Plan written to the harness plan file
`~/.claude/plans/understood-ok-with-all-curious-tide.md` and **approved** (plan
mode). Four decisions (all "recommended"): (1) local stack = single apko pipeline
behind `mise run stack-up` (melange `--runner docker` for macOS), Dockerfile fully
deleted; (2) add **keyless cosign** image signature (GitHub OIDC) on top of kept
attestations; (3) commit **`apko.lock.json`** to pin the Wolfi package set incl. Go
patch; (4) **SLSA L3 deferred** (stays L2; reusable-workflow isolation is a separate
follow-up).

Shipping as **2 squash PRs**: PR1 = Proto→mise + moon system tooling (provable via
`moon ci`); PR2 = Dockerfile→melange/apko (+ cosign + apko.lock + SBOM/provenance
parity). Adversarial-review BLOCKERS folded into the plan: keep `.go-version` until
both `setup-go` repoint to `go.mod` (release.yml:98 + release-dry-run.yml:36 use it —
do in PR2); per-arch **distinct** melange key filenames (single shared key clobbers
on `merge-multiple` → one arch fails verification); `melange --runner docker` (melange
is Linux-only, maintainer on darwin); `syft` image SBOM + `attest-sbom` (apko default
SBOM is apk-level, not Go-module-level — silent regression otherwise);
`actions/attest-build-provenance` (dropping buildx removes `provenance: mode=max` →
zero provenance otherwise); commit `mise.lock` + enforce fail-closed **in the same PR**
that deletes `sqlc-verify`; add `mise.toml`/`mise.lock` to `goSources` (moon doesn't
hash system-binary versions → stale cache on Go bump). Full design dossier (explore +
4 designs + 2 critiques) saved under session scratchpad `wf_*.md`.

Env note: local tools — moon 2.3.5, proto 0.58.1, go 1.26.4, docker 29.4.0 present;
`go.mod` pins `go 1.26.4` (so setup-go → go.mod is clean). **mise was NOT installed;
developer installed it via brew.** Next: PR1 worktree off master, author config,
`mise lock` (4 platforms incl linux-arm64), verify `moon ci` green + fail-closed lock.

## 2026-06-27 15:36 — PR1 shipped (open + all CI green)
**PR #24** `build(tooling): replace proto with mise and run moon on system binaries`
— branch `build/proto-to-mise` (commit `52b0143`), off master. All checks GREEN:
`ci` (moon, 1m3s), GitHub Pages (docs via mise uv/python), CodeQL go+actions,
Kusari Inspector; release/container dry-run jobs correctly skip on a non-release
branch. Awaiting developer review/merge.

What landed: `mise.toml` (go/python/uv + aqua CLIs golangci-lint/sqlc/mockery/goose
+ moon/melange/apko/cosign; `[settings] lockfile+locked`; `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`) +
committed `mise.lock` (11 tools x 4 platforms). `moon.yml`: `proto run X --` -> bare
commands, `toolchains.default: system`, **`sqlc-verify` task + deps removed**,
fileGroups (incl `goSources`) track `mise.toml`/`mise.lock`. `.moon/toolchains.yml`
+ `docs/moon.yml` -> system (no managed toolchains). `ci.yml`/`docs-pages.yml`:
`moonrepo/setup-toolchain` -> `jdx/mise-action@v4.2.0` (SHA-pinned), `uv cache dir`,
cache keys -> `mise.lock`. Deleted `.prototools`, `.moon/proto/*`, `.nvmrc`. Prose
(README/CONTRIBUTING/DELETE_ME) updated. Kept `.go-version` + Dockerfile (PR2 moves
them). Verified locally: `moon run root:check` green (10 tasks via mise tooling) +
fail-closed lock proven by a checksum-tamper (`Checksum mismatch`).

GOTCHAs: (1) mise `lockfile=true` alone does NOT create `mise.lock` on install —
must `touch mise.lock` first, then `mise lock --platform <all>`. (2) `mise lock`
RESOLVES but does not PERSIST the moon `macos-x64` entry (mise write quirk) —
hand-added from moon's official `.sha256`; re-running `mise lock` may drop it. (3)
enforcement key is `settings.locked` (fail-closed); `settings.lockfile` enables the
file. (4) aqua backend verifies cosign/SLSA/GitHub-attestations by default — a
strict upgrade over Proto `checksum-url` (confirmed at install time).

Next: **PR2** = Dockerfile -> melange/apko (+ keyless cosign, apko.lock.json, syft
SBOM + attest-build-provenance, native-runner multi-arch, compose via `mise run
stack-up`). Base PR2 off master AFTER PR1 merges (consumes PR1's mise tools) or
stack on `build/proto-to-mise`. melange/apko/cosign already pinned in mise.toml.

## 2026-06-27 16:16 — PR1 merged; PR2 shipped (open + all CI green)
PR1 (#24) **merged** to master (`7aac1e1`); worktree/branch cleaned up (remote
auto-deleted). PR2 opened off the updated master.

**PR2 #25** `build(release): build the container image with melange + apko` —
branch `build/melange-apko` (commit `2617376`). Replaces the Dockerfile with
melange (signed Wolfi apk) + apko (minimal multi-arch nonroot image) + keyless
cosign + attest-build-provenance + syft image SBOM. GoReleaser binary path
unchanged (setup-go → go.mod). Deleted Dockerfile/.dockerignore/.go-version. New
mise tasks `image-local`/`stack-up`; compose runs the prebuilt `template-go-api:dev`.

**DECISION CHANGE (mid-flight):** apko.lock.json (plan decision #3) was DROPPED —
`apko lock` insists on resolving the per-build `@local` app apk for all arches, and
a committed lock would pin a stale app checksum that breaks the next release. The
developer chose (AskUserQuestion) to **float the Wolfi base + Go** and rely on the
per-build SBOM + provenance attestation for auditability (idiomatic Wolfi;
fresh CAs/tzdata/low-CVE). So no version pins, no lockfile.

VALIDATION (all green):
- Local: `melange build` (arm64, --runner docker) → `apko build` → docker run smoke
  (`--version` shows --vars-file stamping; `openapi: 3.0.3`), uid 65532, ~24 MB.
- Local day-one stack: `mise run image-local` + `docker compose up` → postgres/
  migrate/seed/api healthy; `GET /v1/todos` w/ dev-user-key returns 3 seeded todos,
  401 without. `moon run root:check` green.
- CI on PR #25: `ci` (moon) pass, CodeQL go+actions pass, GitHub Pages pass, Kusari
  pass. Dispatched `release-dry-run` (build/melange-apko ref) → **success**: Melange
  Build Dry Run (amd64 + arm64 native, no QEMU) + Container Image Dry Run (apko
  assemble + smoke). Dispatched `security-scan` → **success** (Trivy clean on the
  apko image). NOT yet exercised: the tag-triggered publish→cosign→attest path
  (needs a real/throwaway prerelease tag against a scratch GHCR namespace).

GOTCHAs discovered building PR2:
- Wolfi has NO `nonroot` PACKAGE — create the user via apko `accounts` (users/groups
  + run-as 65532), mirroring Chainguard images.
- mise config discovery walks UP from the nested `.wt/<branch>` worktree and also
  loads the MAIN checkout's mise.toml (now present on master) — must `mise trust`
  BOTH the worktree and the parent config.
- apko writes a default SBOM (`sbom-*.spdx.json`) to CWD if `--sbom-path` isn't set
  — gitignore `*.spdx.json` (it leaked into staging once).
- apko single-arch `build` loads as `<tag>-<arch>` (e.g. `:dev-arm64`) — retag to
  `:dev` for compose.
- melange/apko CI jobs are gated to release-please branches, so a normal PR doesn't
  exercise them — dispatch `release-dry-run`/`security-scan` on the branch to test.

Both PRs (mise+moon, melange+apko) now CI-green. PR1 merged; PR2 awaiting developer
review/merge. Migration COMPLETE pending PR2 merge + a real release-tag rehearsal.
SLSA L3 (reusable-workflow isolation) remains the deferred follow-up.

## 2026-06-27 17:02 — PR2 merged; SLSA L3 follow-up (#26) shipped
PR2 (#25) **merged** to master (`4098277`). (Note: SSH key dropped mid-session
right after the merge — `gh pr merge` went through the API fine, but `git fetch`/
push over SSH failed; resolved when the developer re-added the key. Then ff'd local
master, removed the build/melange-apko worktree, and this journal push resumed.)

**SLSA L3 research + decision (3 AskUserQuestion turns):** Researched the L3 path.
Key facts: L3 over L2 = run isolation + **signing-key inaccessible to build steps**
(NOT hermetic builds). In-job `attest*` = L2. Two paths: (A) **slsa-github-generator**
reusable workflows → community/`slsa-verifier`-verifiable L3, BUT it moves provenance
OFF GitHub's attestation API (Sigstore + release-asset/OCI; you'd use `slsa-verifier`,
not `gh attestation verify`); (B) move `attest*` into a **reusable workflow** →
GitHub-claimed L3, **keeps GitHub's attestation API + `gh attestation verify`**, but
not `slsa-verifier`-recognized. Developer asked specifically about losing GitHub's
attestation API → **chose Option B** to keep it. (Also: the slsa-github-generator is
mid-redesign to sit ON TOP of GitHub artifact attestations — convergence — another
reason B.)

**PR #26** `ci(release): generate provenance in an isolated reusable workflow (SLSA L3)`
— branch `ci/slsa-l3-provenance` (commit `2df98a4`), off master. Adds
`.github/workflows/attest.yml` (reusable, `workflow_call`): `actions/attest`
(binary checksums via uploaded artifact) + `attest-build-provenance` (image by
name+digest). `release.yml`: build jobs drop in-job provenance attest; new
`attest-binaries`/`attest-image` jobs call `attest.yml`. **Kept in the build job:**
keyless cosign sign + syft SBOM attestation (separate controls, not the SLSA
provenance). RIPPLE FIXED: provenance signer moved release.yml→attest.yml, so
updated `ghd.toml` signer_workflow, `stage_ghd_release_assets.py` expected_signer
(+ its unittest), `release-dry-run.yml` expected_signer, and the summary's
`gh attestation verify --signer-workflow` (cosign verify stays release.yml — cosign
signer unchanged). README "Release Layer" prose fixed (also corrected a stale
"BuildKit provenance" line left from PR2). VALIDATION: stage_ghd test green; 3
workflow YAMLs valid; PR #26 CI green (ci/CodeQL/Pages/Kusari); dispatched
`release-dry-run` → **success** (build path + the attest.yml ghd-signer-consistency
check). attest.yml's runtime only fires on a real release.yml tag — the throwaway
prerelease-tag rehearsal now validates publish + cosign + L3 attest together.

GOTCHA (L3): L3 = unforgeable provenance, NOT a trustworthy build — the build job
still computes the hashes/digest it passes; the gate is signing-key isolation. And
Option B's "L3" is GitHub's self-asserted claim (reusable-workflow isolation), not a
`slsa-verifier`-recognized builder ID — the deliberate trade for keeping
`gh attestation verify`.

STATE: PR1+PR2 merged. **PR #26 (L3) open, green, awaiting developer review/merge.**
Still owed before first real release: the throwaway-prerelease-tag rehearsal (now
covers melange/apko publish + cosign + L3 attest in one go).

## 2026-06-27 17:08 — PR #26 merged; all three PRs landed
PR #26 (SLSA L3) **merged** to master (`8d5007d`); worktree/branch cleaned up,
remote auto-deleted. All three session-015 PRs are now on master:
- #24 `7aac1e1` — Proto → mise + moon system tooling.
- #25 `4098277` — Dockerfile → melange/apko (+ keyless cosign, SBOM/provenance attest).
- #26 `8d5007d` — provenance generated in an isolated reusable workflow (SLSA L3).
Tooling migration + L3 are COMPLETE on master. ONLY remaining item: the
throwaway-prerelease-tag rehearsal (validates melange/apko publish + cosign + the
attest.yml L3 path together) before the first real release — not yet run; developer
asked to pause. Session left clean (working tree clean; local master == origin).

## 2026-06-27 17:20 — Forced 1.0.1 release → release.yml STARTUP_FAILURE (bug caught)
Developer asked to force a release + observe + log failures. Flow worked up to the
release run: forced via PR #27 (empty commit, squash-merged with `Release-As: 1.0.1`)
→ release-please opened PR #28 (`chore(master): release 1.0.1`, bumped manifest +
CHANGELOG + **apko.yaml/melange.yaml via extra-files** — confirmed working) → PR #28
CI all green INCLUDING the full melange/apko dry-run on both arches → merged →
release-please cut tag **v1.0.1** + draft release.

**FAILURE: the tag-triggered `release.yml` run (28306107970) = `startup_failure`
(0 jobs, 0s).** GitHub: "this run likely failed because of a workflow file issue."
ROOT CAUSE (high confidence, from the config): the reusable workflow
`.github/workflows/attest.yml`'s `attest` job declares `permissions: { id-token,
attestations, contents, packages: write }`, but the caller job **`attest-binaries`**
(in release.yml) grants only `{ id-token, attestations, contents }` — no `packages`.
A reusable workflow may not request MORE permissions than its caller grants, so
GitHub rejects the entire workflow at startup. (`attest-image` DOES grant
`packages`, so only the binary caller is the offender — but one bad call fails the
whole run.) This path was NEVER exercised before: the dry-run doesn't call
attest.yml, and a normal PR doesn't run release.yml — only a real tag does. The
rehearsal did its job: caught the bug before a (silently wrong) release.

HALF-STATE (clean — nothing published): tag `v1.0.1` exists; draft release `v1.0.1`
exists with **0 assets**; **no GHCR image** published; **no cosign/attestations**
(release.yml never ran a job). So nothing to un-publish from a registry/Rekor.

FIX (two options; NOT applied — paused per instruction):
- Cleanest: drop attest.yml's job-level `permissions:` block (and the top-level
  `permissions: {}`) so each caller's `uses`-job permissions define the token —
  attest-binaries grants {id-token,attestations,contents}, attest-image grants
  {+packages}; each call gets exactly its grant, no over-request. (Verify a
  reusable job with no permissions block inherits the caller grant.)
- Simplest/safe: add `packages: write` to the `attest-binaries` caller job so both
  callers match the shared reusable job's declared perms (harmless over-grant).
RECOVERY before re-release: delete tag `v1.0.1` + the draft release, land the fix on
master (PR), then re-force (release-please re-cuts v1.0.1, or bump to 1.0.2).

Paused. PR1/PR2/PR3(L3) remain merged + good; only the forced-release rehearsal
surfaced this reusable-workflow permissions bug to fix before the first real release.

## 2026-06-27 17:59 — Fix/rerun loop: 3 release-pipeline bugs found+fixed; v1.0.4 RELEASED + verified
Developer said "proceed with fix/rerun." The first real-tag release shook out THREE
distinct bugs in the never-before-run release.yml path; each fixed via a
`fix(release):` PR (auto-triggers the next release-please patch), re-run, repeat:
1. **v1.0.1 startup_failure** — reusable `attest.yml` job declared `packages: write`
   but the `attest-binaries` caller granted fewer scopes (reusable workflow can't
   exceed caller). FIX PR #29 (`fix`): grant `packages: write` to attest-binaries.
2. **v1.0.2 apko publish failure** — `apko publish --sbom-path ./sbom` can't move
   SBOMs into a non-existent dir. FIX PR #31: `mkdir -p sbom` before publish.
3. **v1.0.3 attest-image failure** — `attest-build-provenance --push-to-registry`
   runs in attest.yml's OWN runner with no GHCR creds (`No credentials found for
   registry ghcr.io`); the build job's docker login doesn't carry into the reusable
   workflow. FIX PR #33: add `docker/login-action` (ghcr) on the image path in
   attest.yml. (Note: v1.0.3 still published image + cosign-signed + SBOM-attested;
   only its provenance attestation was missing.)

**v1.0.4 = FULL SUCCESS, end-to-end green + cryptographically verified:**
- Binaries: 9 draft-release assets (4 bin + 4 syft SBOM + checksums); provenance
  attested via the isolated attest.yml (L3).
- Image `ghcr.io/meigma/template-go-api:v1.0.4` (linux/amd64+arm64): published,
  **cosign keyless-signed** (verified, signer release.yml), **syft SBOM attested**,

  `…/attest.yml@refs/tags/v1.0.4` (confirms L3 isolation + stays on GitHub's
  attestation API). Multi-arch manifest = linux/amd64,linux/arm64.
- v1.0.4 GitHub release left as a DRAFT by design (human publishes after inspection).

KEY DURABLE LESSON (for the template / TECH_NOTES at close): a reusable attest
workflow needs (a) every caller to grant ≥ the scopes the shared job declares
(packages on the binary caller too), and (b) its OWN `docker/login-action` for any
`push-to-registry` attestation — the calling job's registry login does not cross
the reusable-workflow boundary. Also apko `--sbom-path <dir>` requires the dir to
pre-exist. None of these are reachable by the dry-run (which never calls attest.yml
and never pushes) — only a real tag exercises them, which is exactly why the forced
release was worth doing.

CLEANUP: deleted the broken draft releases v1.0.1/v1.0.2/v1.0.3 (kept v1.0.4 draft +
the pre-existing v1.0.0 draft). RESIDUE the developer may want to tidy: tags
v1.0.1-1.0.3 still exist (left consistent with CHANGELOG, likely protected);
CHANGELOG.md carries 1.0.1-1.0.4 entries (history of the shakeout); GHCR may hold
superseded v1.0.2/v1.0.3 image tags (the org-scoped packages API needs
`/orgs/meigma/packages/...`; not deleted — referrer-aware cleanup left to the dev).
Migration COMPLETE; release pipeline proven on a real tag at v1.0.4.
